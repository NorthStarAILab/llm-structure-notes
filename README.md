This repository contains notes and observations on the structural aspects of reasoning
and alignment in large language models (LLMs).

The focus is on how inference structure, consistency, and internal constraints
affect reliability and behavior, rather than on implementation details
or prompt engineering techniques.

These materials are intended as research notes and conceptual explorations
related to LLM reasoning and alignment.

This repository serves as a personal research log.
Research notes on structure-first inference, consistency constraints, 
and alignment-relevant reasoning in large language models (LLMs).
