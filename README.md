Research Timeline — Structure-Centered Reasoning in LLMs

This repository serves as a public research timeline documenting the prior definition, naming, and structural formulation of concepts related to structure-centered reasoning, predictive consistency, and cognitive alignment in large language models (LLMs).
The purpose of this repository is not collaboration, implementation, validation, or review.
Its sole function is to publicly anchor the existence of specific technical terms, frameworks, and reasoning modes at a defined point in time.

1️⃣ Predictive-Consistency Mode (PCM)
Core Terms
Predictive-Consistency Mode (PCM)
Self-Diagnostic Reasoning
Predictive Constraint Loop
Internal Consistency Stabilization

Structural Definition
PCM is a reasoning mode in which LLM outputs are governed by predictive consistency constraints across inference steps, rather than post-hoc correction or output filtering.
The primary objective is not correctness per se, but structural coherence of the reasoning trajectory itself.
Hallucination is treated not as a data insufficiency problem, but as a failure of internal predictive structure.

2️⃣ NorthStar Cognitive Alignment Framework (NCAF)
Core Terms
NorthStar Cognitive Alignment Framework (NCAF)
Reset / Observe / Deconstruct / Reconstruct
Cognitive Alignment Flow

Structural Definition
NCAF is a structure-centered cognitive alignment framework describing how reasoning stability is formed and restored.
Alignment is treated as a process-level structural property, not as a reward-optimization outcome.
The framework prioritizes cognitive reset and reconstruction mechanisms over instruction-following behavior.

3️⃣ Cognitive Frame Shift and Structure-First Inference
Core Terms
Cognitive Frame Shift
Structural Trigger
Structure-First Inference
Frame-Level Transition

Observed Pattern
Under specific structural conditions, LLM responses exhibit discrete frame-level transitions, rather than continuous probabilistic drift.
This phenomenon is independent of prompt phrasing techniques and correlates with internal reorganization of inference structure.
These observations suggest the presence of latent structural states within LLM reasoning processes.

📎 Scope Clarification
This repository contains no implementation code.
No model parameters, training data, or deployment details are included.
Intellectual property documentation exists separately and is explicitly outside the scope of this repository.
This repository functions solely as a public timestamp and terminology anchor.

🔒 Intent Statement
This repository is intended to establish that the above concepts, terms, and structural interpretations
were already articulated, named, and organized at the time of publication.
No claims, requests, predictions, or solicitations are made.
