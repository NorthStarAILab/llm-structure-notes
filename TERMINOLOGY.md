Terminology

Predictive-Consistency Mode (PCM)
A reasoning mode in large language models where outputs are constrained by predictive consistency across inference steps, prioritizing internal coherence over post-hoc correction.

NorthStar Cognitive Alignment Framework (NCAF)
A structure-centered cognitive alignment framework describing how reasoning stability is formed, disrupted, and restored through reset and reconstruction mechanisms.

Structure-First Inference
An inference paradigm in which structural constraints govern reasoning trajectories prior to output generation, rather than relying on probabilistic filtering after generation.

Cognitive Frame Shift
A discrete transition between internal reasoning frames in an LLM, observed under specific structural trigger conditions.

Predictive Constraint Loop
An internal loop mechanism enforcing consistency between anticipated and generated reasoning states during inference.
